## 📌 Project Summary

This project applies the **YOLOv8l** object detection model to identify three critical object types frequently found in industrial and safety-critical environments:

- 🔥 Fire Extinguisher  
- 🧰 Toolbox  
- 🧪 Oxygen Tank

The pipeline covers end-to-end stages: **data preparation**, **augmentation**, **training**, **fine-tuning**, and **evaluation** — with a strong focus on real-world robustness including occlusion handling and lighting challenges.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Build an accurate and efficient object detection model using **YOLOv8**, and optimize it to achieve the highest possible **mAP@0.5** score under practical constraints.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Total Images**: 1,139
- **Classes**: 3 (Balanced)
- **Format**: YOLO-annotated bounding boxes
- **Split**: 80% Training / 20% Validation
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resizing to 640x640
  - Class balancing
  - Label smoothing
  - Occlusion-aware augmentation

### ❌ Failure Cases & Insights

While the model achieved strong overall performance, it faced challenges in certain real-world scenarios:

- **Low Lighting Conditions**: Toolbox detection failed in dark environments.
- **Partial Occlusion**: OxygenTanks were frequently missed when partially hidden behind other objects.

These failures guided targeted augmentation strategies, such as HSV brightness adjustment and occlusion-aware transforms.

#### 🔎 Visual Example

| Model Prediction Output | Ground Truth Labels |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| ![Model Output](./assets/failure_cases.png) | ![Ground Truth](./assets/failure_cases.png) |

In this example, the model fails to detect the toolbox in low-light conditions (left), while the ground truth clearly labels it (right).

#### 🔧 Adjustments Made

```python
hsv_h = 0.015
hsv_s = 0.7
hsv_v = 0.7  # Increased brightness
mosaic = 0.8
```
